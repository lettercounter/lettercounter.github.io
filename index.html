 <h4>How Many Letters in the Alphabet?</h4>
   <p>
     Composed of 26 letters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant">consonants</a> and <a href="https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/vowel">vowels</a>), the English alphabet evolved from the Latin alphabet while the English language developed from adopting bits and pieces from Germanic languages related to German, Frisian and Dutch. In addition, the construction of the English vocabulary is a fascinating amalgamation of words and letters borrowed from the French, Greek, Latin and dozens of other languages.
     <br><br>
   The English alphabet used today is actually a variation of the old Latin alphabet composed of 26 vowels and consonants. Although the English alphabet is easily recognizable by its ordered form–A, B, C, D–this alphabet also employs numerous diagraphs, or combinations of consonants to make sounds differing from the sound of a single consonant. For example, “c” and “h” are pronounced like “cee” and “aitch” but together they produce the sound “ch”, which forms words like “choke” and “cherry”.

   <h4>Histoy of the English Alphabet</h4> 
   
   Originally, the 26 letters we consider the English alphabet were written in a runic alphabet called the <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/futhorc.htm" target="_blank">Anglo-Saxon futhorc</a> (5th century, A.D.). Transferred to England by Anglo-Saxon settlers, this very early version of our English alphabet now exists only in fragmented inscriptions written on stone or parchment material.
   
When considering how many letters in the English alphabet eventually replaced the somewhat chaotic Anglo-Saxon alphabet, historians think the more organized nature of our alphabet emerged from Christian missionaries introducing the Latin alphabet to the Saxons sometime in the 7th century.
